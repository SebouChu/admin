      text: Administration, in its many forms, is defined primarily by its activities in the service of the general interest. It acts in the general interest and respects the principle of legality. It is bound by the obligation of neutrality and respect for the principle of secularism. It complies with the principle of equality and guarantees everyone impartial treatment.
